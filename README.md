I'm a problem solving software developer, authorized accounting consultant and certified IT-Architect.

I usually work as a security conscious software developer and IT-Architect.

I prefer databases, business processes and release management before user interfaces and reports.

**I'm looking for small remote assignments.**

My main experience is in GO, C#, VB6, SQL though I probably know enough Python and PHP to dive in to most challenges.

I'm not afraid of operating Wordpress, SQL-Server, Linux or Windows.
